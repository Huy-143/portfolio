# SQL Project Portfolio 

### Foreword
Hello there, my name is Huy.
I am currently teaching myself SQL and I will use this repository to showcase, cases and exercises that I have worked on. 

The first cases that I will add, belong to a series of case studies called "8weeksqlchallenge" published by Danny Ma, a professional in the Data field that created the scenarios which do not only serve as good exercise but also reflect realistic questions and are partially based on real examples. I will include the link to each case so you can check it out and try it as well :)
