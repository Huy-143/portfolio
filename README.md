# SQL Project Portfolio 

### Foreword
Hello there, my name is Huy.
I am currently teaching myself SQL and I will use this repository to showcase, cases and exercises that I have worked on. 

### Data Sources
The first cases that I will add, belong to a series of case studies called "8weeksqlchallenge" published by Danny Ma, a professional in the Data field that created the scenarios that do not only serve as good exercise but also reflect realistic questions and are partially based on real examples. The cases can be found here: https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/
